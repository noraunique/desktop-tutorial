System Maintenance

System maintenance is the routine preventive and corrective work that keeps networked systems secure, reliable, and performant. Regular maintenance of the networked systems helps them to run more smoothly as well as reduce the risk of break downs. By having a well-designed maintenance schedule assists you in organizing your maintenance tasks.

Key aspects of system maintenance include:
- Applying updates and security patches
- Running and testing backups
- Monitoring and log review
- Hardware and capacity checks
- System housekeeping

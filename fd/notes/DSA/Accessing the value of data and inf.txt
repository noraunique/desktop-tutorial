Accessing the value of data and information to individuals in real-world business process at STC Supermarket

Accessing the value of data and information to individuals in real-world business processes at STC Supermarket is very important because it helps each person carry out their role more effectively and with fewer errors. Every employee in the supermarket, from the manager to the cashier, benefits from having the right information at the right time. For example, managers need access to sales and inventory data to make decisions about ordering stock and running promotions. Cashiers rely on point-of-sale information to bill customers accurately and quickly. Floor staff need access to shelf and stock data to refill products and guide customers when they ask for assistance. Suppliers also benefit when they receive clear and accurate order information from the supermarket, because it allows them to deliver the right goods on time. Even customers indirectly benefit when staff members have access to data, as it ensures smoother service and better availability of products. By accessing accurate data, individuals in the supermarket can avoid guesswork, take decisions confidently, and perform their duties in a way that supports both the customer experience and the overall business process.

Managers
Managers in STC Supermarket rely on access to data for almost every decision they make. Sales reports show which products are in high demand, while inventory data shows stock shortages and expiry risks. Supplier information helps managers decide from whom to order and when. Financial data provides insight into daily revenue and costs. With access to this data, managers can make evidence-based decisions that reduce waste, improve efficiency, and maintain profitability. For example, if sales data shows that milk powder is selling faster than usual, the manager can immediately increase the next order to avoid disappointing customers. Access to data also helps managers plan promotions, schedule employees, and respond quickly to problems.

Cashiers
Cashiers also benefit directly from access to data and information. At the cashier counters, point-of-sale systems provide product details, prices, and discount information when items are scanned. This access ensures that customers are billed accurately and fairly, while also making the cashier’s job easier and faster. Transaction data allows cashiers to close tills at the end of the day and confirm that recorded sales match the money collected. By having access to accurate data, cashiers reduce mistakes, build customer trust, and complete transactions efficiently.

Floor staff
Floor staff and sales assistants use data about stock levels, shelf arrangements, and promotions to carry out their work. Access to inventory data tells them which shelves need refilling and which items need to be displayed in visible areas to promote sales. Staff also use promotion data to guide customers about current discounts or bundle offers. For example, if customers ask whether a particular product is included in a discount, floor staff can answer confidently if they have access to the right information. This access improves customer service and ensures that stock is rotated properly to avoid waste.

Suppliers
Suppliers may not be inside the supermarket, but they also benefit from access to accurate order information and delivery schedules. When the supermarket shares clear order data, suppliers know exactly what quantities and products are required, which allows them to plan production and transportation effectively. This reduces delivery errors, prevents late shipments, and helps maintain strong supplier relationships. Access to supermarket data ensures that suppliers can support the store’s procurement process smoothly, which in turn benefits the entire business.

Employees in general
All employees, including support staff such as cleaners and stock handlers, benefit from access to work-related data like shift schedules, duty rosters, and attendance records. This clarity ensures that everyone knows their role and when they are expected to work. It reduces confusion, avoids conflicts, and ensures smooth workflow across the supermarket. By accessing accurate information, employees can focus on their duties without misunderstanding or mistakes, which improves overall productivity and job satisfaction.

Cashiers benefit from access to point-of-sale data, which ensures accurate billing and smooth financial recording. Floor staff rely on access to inventory and promotion data to keep shelves filled, rotate stock, and guide customers with confidence. Suppliers benefit from access to accurate orders and delivery schedules, which help them provide reliable service and maintain trust.
